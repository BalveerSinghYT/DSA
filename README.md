# 100 Days of Code Journey 🚀

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode journey! 🌟 Follow along as I dive into the world of programming, honing my skills and embracing new knowledge every day. Let's turn each line of code into a step towards mastery! 💻📚

## Day 0 - August 26th:

🎉 **Started the Journey**: Embarked on this coding adventure, ready to learn and grow!

## Day 1 - August 27th:

🎯 **Progress**: Explored the basics of C++ and realized there's so much more to learn! 🤯

📚 **Topics**: Pointers, Pass by value/address, References, Array Pointers, Pointer to Structure.

## Day 2 - August 28th:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed Section 2 of the C/C++ essentials journey. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts, Classes, and Template classes are unlocked! 💡

📚 **Topics**: OOPS Principles, Class Fundamentals, Template Class Tricks.

## Day 3 - August 29th:

🎯 **Progress**: Wrapped up Section 4 of Abdul Bari's Mastering DSA course. Explored memory management, data structures, and complexities. 💪

📚 **Topics**: Stack vs Heap Memory, Physical vs Logical Data Structures, Abstract Datatypes, Time and space Complexity.

## Day 4 - August 30th:

🎯 **Progress**: Dived into the magic of recursion! Unraveled the mysteries of stack usage, types of recursion, and complexity calculations.

📚 **Topics**: How recursion uses stack, Types of Recursion, Complexity Calculation.

## Day 5 - August 31st:

🎯 **Progress**: Today was a bit challenging. Deep into the world of recursion, taking it step by step, and ensuring a thorough understanding.

Sometimes progress may be slow, but it's still progress! 🚀

## Day 6 - September 1st:

🎯 **Progress**: I wasn't able to cover much today, but tried to cover those concepts of arrays, which I never touched.

## Day 7 - September 2nd:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed the Array representation section, delving into compiler magic and row/column major formulas for arrays. 📊💡

## Day 8 - September 3rd:

🎯 **Progress**: A day of competition! Participated in the GFG contest and implemented various array-related operations with enthusiasm. 💻🏆

## Day 9 - September 4th:

🎯 **Progress**: A day packed with array manipulation! Explored linear and binary search, and mastered array operations like getting, setting, finding averages, finding max values, reversing, shifting, and rotating. 💡💻

## Day 10 - September 5th:

🎯 **Progress**: Sorting, merging, union, intersection, and difference between two arrays - today's array adventures took me to new heights of manipulation! 🔄🧩

## Day 11 - September 6th:

🎯 **Progress**: Overcame procrastination to conquer the "stock buy and sell" problem on GeeksforGeeks, a challenge that had stumped me last month. Code optimization is next! 📈🤓

## Day 12 - September 7th:

🎯 **Progress**: Tackled the backlog today! 📝 Wrapped up pending topics with code for array and set operations. Clearing the path for more coding adventures! 🚀💻

## Day 13 - September 8th:

🎯 **Progress**: Navigating the world of missing elements! 🧩 Explored various scenarios in finding missing elements in arrays - sorted from 1, sorted from random numbers, and dealing with multiple missing elements. 🕵️‍♀️🔍

## Day 14 - September 9th:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed the Array ADT section today! Explored different methods to find duplicates in sorted and unsorted arrays, uncovering pairs of elements with a given sum, and finding max/min in a single scan. 🧐🔍

## Day 15 - September 10th:

🎯 **Progress**: Explored the world of Strings! 🧵 Found Abdul Bari sir's Udemy course on DSA really useful, well-structured, and interactive. 💡 Covered a range of string operations - from length and case changes to counting words, vowels, validation, and reversing. 🚀💬 #100DaysOfCode #StringMagic 👩‍💻📖

Every challenge is a chance to grow! 💪

## Day 16 - September 11th:

🎯 **Progress**: Delved deep into strings today! Wrote my own functions for string operations - length, word count, vowels count, lower, and upper case. Also explored non-string topics, like palindromes, and tackled the GCD problem using recursion. The journey continues! 🚀🧩 #100DaysOfCode #CodingJourney 👩‍💻📚

## Day 17 - September 12th:

🎯 **Progress**: No major update today, just solved three basic problems on HackerRank.
