# 100 Days of Code Journey 🚀

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode journey! 🌟 Follow along as I dive into the world of programming, honing my skills and embracing new knowledge every day. Let's turn each line of code into a step towards mastery! 💻📚

## Day 0 - August 26th:

🎉 **Started the Journey**: Embarked on this coding adventure, ready to learn and grow!

## Day 1 - August 27th:

🎯 **Progress**: Explored the basics of C++ and realized there's so much more to learn! 🤯

📚 **Topics**: Pointers, Pass by value/address, References, Array Pointers, Pointer to Structure.

## Day 2 - August 28th:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed Section 2 of the C/C++ essentials journey. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts, Classes, and Template classes are unlocked! 💡

📚 **Topics**: OOPS Principles, Class Fundamentals, Template Class Tricks.

## Day 3 - August 29th:

🎯 **Progress**: Wrapped up Section 4 of Abdul Bari's Mastering DSA course. Explored memory management, data structures, and complexities. 💪

📚 **Topics**: Stack vs Heap Memory, Physical vs Logical Data Structures, Abstract Datatypes, Time and space Complexity.

## Day 4 - August 30th:

🎯 **Progress**: Dived into the magic of recursion! Unraveled the mysteries of stack usage, types of recursion, and complexity calculations.

📚 **Topics**: How recursion uses stack, Types of Recursion, Complexity Calculation.

## Day 5 - August 31st:

🎯 **Progress**: Today was a bit challenging. Deep into the world of recursion, taking it step by step, and ensuring a thorough understanding.

Sometimes progress may be slow, but it's still progress! 🚀

## Day 6 - September 1st:

🎯 **Progress**: I wasn't able to cover much today, but tried to cover those concepts of arrays, which I never touched.

## Day 7 - September 2nd:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed the Array representation section, delving into compiler magic and row/column major formulas for arrays. 📊💡

## Day 8 - September 3rd:

🎯 **Progress**: A day of competition! Participated in the GFG contest and implemented various array-related operations with enthusiasm. 💻🏆

## Day 9 - September 4th:

🎯 **Progress**: A day packed with array manipulation! Explored linear and binary search, and mastered array operations like getting, setting, finding averages, finding max values, reversing, shifting, and rotating. 💡💻

## Day 10 - September 5th:

🎯 **Progress**: Sorting, merging, union, intersection, and difference between two arrays - today's array adventures took me to new heights of manipulation! 🔄🧩

## Day 11 - September 6th:

🎯 **Progress**: Overcame procrastination to conquer the "stock buy and sell" problem on GeeksforGeeks, a challenge that had stumped me last month. Code optimization is next! 📈🤓


Every challenge is a chance to grow! 💪

Tomorrow, it's on to the Array Abstract Data Type - the adventure continues! 🚀


Let's keep this coding momentum going! Exciting times ahead as I continue this journey of growth and learning. Stay tuned for more updates! 🌱👩‍💻
