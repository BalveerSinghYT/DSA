Sometimes progress may be slow, but it's still progress! 🚀

## Day 6 - September 1st:

🎯 **Progress**: I wasn't able to cover much today, but tried to cover those concepts of arrays, which I never touched.

## Day 7 - September 2nd:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed the Array representation section, delving into compiler magic and row/column major formulas for arrays. 📊💡

## Day 8 - September 3rd:

🎯 **Progress**: A day of competition! Participated in the GFG contest and implemented various array-related operations with enthusiasm. 💻🏆

## Day 9 - September 4th:

🎯 **Progress**: A day packed with array manipulation! Explored linear and binary search, and mastered array operations like getting, setting, finding averages, finding max values, reversing, shifting, and rotating. 💡💻

## Day 10 - September 5th:

🎯 **Progress**: Sorting, merging, union, intersection, and difference between two arrays - today's array adventures took me to new heights of manipulation! 🔄🧩

## Day 11 - September 6th:

🎯 **Progress**: Overcame procrastination to conquer the "stock buy and sell" problem on GeeksforGeeks, a challenge that had stumped me last month. Code optimization is next! 📈🤓

## Day 12 - September 7th:

🎯 **Progress**: Tackled the backlog today! 📝 Wrapped up pending topics with code for array and set operations. Clearing the path for more coding adventures! 🚀💻

## Day 13 - September 8th:

🎯 **Progress**: Navigating the world of missing elements! 🧩 Explored various scenarios in finding missing elements in arrays - sorted from 1, sorted from random numbers, and dealing with multiple missing elements. 🕵️‍♀️🔍

## Day 14 - September 9th:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed the Array ADT section today! Explored different methods to find duplicates in sorted and unsorted arrays, uncovering pairs of elements with a given sum, and finding max/min in a single scan. 🧐🔍

## Day 15 - September 10th:

🎯 **Progress**: Explored the world of Strings! 🧵 Found Abdul Bari sir's Udemy course on DSA really useful, well-structured, and interactive. 💡 Covered a range of string operations - from length and case changes to counting words, vowels, validation, and reversing. 🚀💬 #100DaysOfCode #StringMagic 👩‍💻📖

Every challenge is a chance to grow! 💪

## Day 16 - September 11th:

🎯 **Progress**: Delved deep into strings today! Wrote my own functions for string operations - length, word count, vowels count, lower, and upper case. Also explored non-string topics, like palindromes, and tackled the GCD problem using recursion. The journey continues! 🚀🧩 #100DaysOfCode #CodingJourney 👩‍💻📚

## Day 17 - September 12th:

🎯 **Progress**: No major update today, just solved three basic problems on HackerRank.

## Day 18 - September 13th:

🎯 **Progress**: Today's topics: Palindrome magic! 🔄 Also, delving into the art of checking duplicates in a string using both recursion and hashing. 🧙‍♂️💡 The coding adventure continues!

## Day 19 - September 14th:

I didn't do much today, got caught up in a web series binge! 😅 But in the end, managed to dive into the world of hashing in strings and explored the magic of bitwise operations for finding duplicates. Progress, no matter how small, is still progress!

## Day 20 - September 15th:

🧵 Wrapped up the Strings section today! 💡 Explored finding duplicates using bit operations, cracked the code on anagrams, and delved into permutations of strings.

## Day 21 - September 16th:

I spent most of my time collecting papers for my research thesis instead of finding anything fruitful related to DSA.
 
## Day 22 - September 17th:

🔄 Revised Recursion concepts & solved a few string-related questions. Also participated in a Leetcode contest and managed to solve one easy-level problem. Started with the Matrices section. The coding journey never stops! 🚀💻

## Day 23 - September 18th:

📊 Unveiled the magic of Diagonal Matrices, Lower and Upper Order Matrices! 🧮 Explored memory optimization by using a single-dimensional array instead of wasting space on null values. Efficiency is key! 💡💾 

## Day 24 - September 19th:

⭐️ Limited time but maximum effort! ⏳🚀 Solved challenging string-related questions on HackerRank using Python, earning my 4th silver badge star. 🌟 Also tackled a problem-solving question, securing my 3rd silver star on HackerRank. The stars keep shining! 🌠💫

## Day 25 - September 20th:

🧠 Today's focus: Memory optimization techniques for Diagonal, Tri-Diagonal/Band, and Toeplitz matrices. 🤖 Also, tackled a few challenges on HackerRank. Learning and coding in full swing! 🚀💡

## Day 26 - September 21st:

🚀 Job-A-Thon adventure on @GeeksForGeeks! 💼 Solved 1 out of 3 questions. The exciting part? First time ever I used the power of pen, paper, & mathematics to drive a formula that cracked the problem (took half an hour!) instead of directly coding 📝🤯

## Day 27 - September 22nd:

📚 Today, the LinkedList journey begins! 🚀 I've been eagerly waiting for this section. Decided to skip Sparse Matrix & Polynomial for now, but they're on my to-do list. Exciting coding adventures ahead! 💡💻

## Day 28 - September 23rd:

🔗 Explored LinkedLists today! 🚀 Implemented linked lists and performed various operations like displaying data, finding length, and calculating the sum of elements. Also, conquered the "problem of the day" on GFG and tackled a few challenges on HackerRank. Progress is shining bright! 💡

## Day 29 - September 24th:

🧩 Challenging day! Participated in two contests but couldn't solve any problems fully. Managed to tackle 2 questions partially. 🤯 On the LinkedList journey, exploring Max, Min, and searching. Learning the art of writing recursive functions for them! 🚀
