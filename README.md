# 100 Days of Code Journey 🚀

Welcome to my #100DaysOfCode journey! 🌟 Follow along as I dive into the world of programming, honing my skills and embracing new knowledge every day. Let's turn each line of code into a step towards mastery! 💻📚

## Day 0 - August 26th:

🎉 **Started the Journey**: Embarked on this coding adventure, ready to learn and grow!

## Day 1 - August 27th:

🎯 **Progress**: Explored the basics of C++ and realized there's so much more to learn! 🤯

📚 **Topics**: Pointers, Pass by value/address, References, Array Pointers, Pointer to Structure.

## Day 2 - August 28th:

🎯 **Progress**: Completed Section 2 of the C/C++ essentials journey. Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts, Classes, and Template classes are unlocked! 💡

📚 **Topics**: OOPS Principles, Class Fundamentals, Template Class Tricks.

## Day 3 - August 29th:

🎯 **Progress**: Wrapped up Section 4 of Abdul Bari's Mastering DSA course. Explored memory management, data structures, and complexities. 💪

📚 **Topics**: Stack vs Heap Memory, Physical vs Logical Data Structures, Abstract Datatypes, Time and space Complexity.

## Day 4 - August 30th:

🎯 **Progress**: Dived into the magic of recursion! Unraveled the mysteries of stack usage, types of recursion, and complexity calculations.

📚 **Topics**: How recursion uses stack, Types of Recursion, Complexity Calculation.

## Day 5 - August 31st:

🎯 **Progress**: Today was a bit challenging. Deep into the world of recursion, taking it step by step, and ensuring a thorough understanding.

Sometimes progress may be slow, but it's still progress! 🚀

## Day 6 - September 1st:

🎯 **Progress**: I wasn't able to cover much today, but tried to cover those concepts of arrays, which I never touched.


Let's keep this coding momentum going! Exciting times ahead as I continue this journey of growth and learning. Stay tuned for more updates! 🌱👩‍💻
